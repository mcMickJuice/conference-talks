# Don't Use Your Mouse

Just don't do it. Think of your wrists. Think of how cool you'll look flying through applications on your machine, code in your editor and surfing the net with a flurry of keystrokes. You thinking of it? Sounds kinda cool, huh? Well below are some keybindings for population applications, as well as links to helpful resources.

Also, give Vim a chance. You'll thank me in two years.

## Misc.

- I used [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) for casting keystrokes during the presentation.
- "In the hands of an expert, (using your keyboard for everything gets things done) at the speed of thought" - Quote, slightly modified, from the introduction in [Practical Vim Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](https://github.com/eposts/Rich/blob/master/blog/Linux/Practical%20Vim%20Edit%20Text%20at%20the%20Speed%20of%20Thought.pdf)

## Built-in Navigation on a Mac

Must haves. If you're brand new to using a keyboard for anything other than text editing, drill on these shortcuts

- `CMD + TAB` (tap) - swap between current and previous applications
- `CMD` (hold) + `TAB` (tap), then tap TAB - navigates through open programs. Hold down SHIFT to navigate backwards
- `CMD + `` - navigate through instances/windows of the current focused application

## Windowing/Tiling Applications

Organize multiple applications and windows on your monitors

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - free application that makes for easily customizable windowing via keystrokes

## Omnisearch

Spotlight is not enough. We must enhance our machine navigation capabilities

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - the most useful application on my machine

## Text Selection and Manipulation

Universal keybindings for quickly selecting, deleting and manipulating text

- `SHIFT + left/right` - highlight characters
- `SHIFT + OPTION + left/right` - highlight words
- `SHIFT + COMMAND + left/right` - highlight text from cursor to beginning/end of line

Slack at the speed of thought.

Surf the world wide web with the tips of your fingers. I cannot recommend [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) enough.
